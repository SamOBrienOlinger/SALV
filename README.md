A personal and public safety tool for police and people to prevent and prosecute dangerous criminal behavior.

The Batman and The Batwoman probably already have a similar app on their Bat Phones. Alfred and Robin would have to get some access too, I guess. 




The Dark Knights' phones would surely be storeed safely in a special secret hidden pocket with a zip in their capes ðŸ˜ƒ...or maybe for practical reasons, on their gadget belts ðŸ˜’.
